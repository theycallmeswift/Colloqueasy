# Colloqueasy

This is a social networking site built by Mike Swift and Johnathan Maltz for Principles of Information and Data Management (CS 336).

## Tools

This site was built using:

 - Framework: [FuelPHP](http://www.fuelphp.com/)
 - Database: [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)

## Notes

We were not allowed to use an ORM or Active Record class, so all the database queries had to be written manually. :(
